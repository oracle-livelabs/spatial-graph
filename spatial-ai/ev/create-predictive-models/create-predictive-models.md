# Create spatial predictive models

## Introduction

In this lab you create models for predicting EV adoption using spatial regression algorithms.  You then compare model statistics and observe the benefits of employing spatial algorithms.

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

* Create predictive models using spatial algorithms
* Gather metrics and assess the models
* Perform ad hoc predictions
* Understand the behavior and benefits of spatial algorithms
