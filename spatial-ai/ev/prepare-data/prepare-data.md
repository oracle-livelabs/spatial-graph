# Prepare data

## Introduction

In this lab you you prepare your data for ML modeling. This includes adding spatial context to the non-spatial EV and demographics data by merging with spatial data for zip codes. In addition, you fill data gaps using a spatial algorithm and engineer a new feature using spatial analysis. You finally save the prepared data to ADB-S for use in the subsequent labs.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

* Add spatial context to EV and demographics data by joining to zip codes spatial data
