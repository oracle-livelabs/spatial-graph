# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you work with Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) Spatial AI to load and prepare data related to electric vehicle registrations in California, and then create models to predict electric adoption using spatial ML algorithms.  In doing so, you learn how spatial ML algorithms incorporate the effects of location and enhance traditional non-spatial ML with more reliable predictions.

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### About OML4Py Oracle Spatial AI

OML4Py Spatial AI provides specialized machine learning algorithms that incorporate the effects of location. Using machine learning with spatial algorithms can improve model quality and prediction accuracy by accounting for the effects of location. For example, spatial regression algorithms are able to enhance home value predictions by incorporating the influence of neighboring home values. Spatial algorithms also allow you to detect location patterns, like spatial clustering of traffic accidents. As part of OML4Py on Autonomous Database Serverless, Spatial AI provides  a single environment for spatial ML workflows that minimizes data movement to external ML engines, simplifies your architecture, and accelerates time to value.
