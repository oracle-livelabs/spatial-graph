# Upload the excel file in OAC as datasets

## Introduction

In this lab, you will **upload the excel files** required to create the map provided in the resources section. First, we will upload the live race excel file and save it. Next, we will create another dataset by integrating two excel files (race route and speed data) into OAC using an inner join to produce a combined dataset.

_Estimated Time:_Â 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Upload the excel file in OAC as datasets

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or Live Labs Cloud Account
- Provisioned Oracle Analytics Cloud
- All previous labs successfully completed
- Downloaded all the three excels files provided in the resources

## Task 1: Upload the live race excel file

1. Go to Create and select Dataset (**Create**)

    ![Select the create icon](./images/1%20Create%20Dataset.jpg)

2. A dialog box will open. Select the option Drag data file, then choose the live location excel file from your computer. **Drag data file here or click to browse**

    ![Drag data file](./images/2.%20Drag%20Data%20set%20.jpg)

3. Once the live location data loads, click **OK**

    ![Select "OK"](./images/3%20Upload%20Click%20OK.jpg)

4. Go to the live location tab, select the columns Latitude and Longitude, and change their data type to Attribute.

    ![Data Type change](./images/4%20Change%20Data%20Type%20to%20Attribute.jpg)

5. Save the file and name it live location. Your live location file is now ready.

## Task 2: Upload the route and speed excel files as one joint file

1. Go to Create and select Dataset (**Create**)

    ![Select the create icon](./images/1%20Create%20Dataset.jpg)

2. A dialog box will open. Select the option Drag Data File, then choose the route excel file from your computer. **Drag data file here or click to browse**

    ![Drag data file](./images/2.%20Drag%20Data%20set%20.jpg)

3. Once the Route data loads, click **OK**

    ![Select "OK"](./images/2%20Upload%20joint%20excel%20file/3%20Select%20the%20route%20data%20set%20and%20name%20it%20route.png)

4. Open the route data tab and go to **meta data icon**

    ![metadata"](./images/2%20Upload%20joint%20excel%20file/4%20Select%20the%20route%20and%20go%20to%20meta%20data.png)

5. Change all columns to Attribute (they should not be numerical)

    ![Change data type](./images/2%20Upload%20joint%20excel%20file/5%20Select%20all%20the%20highlighted%20columns%20and%20change%20the%20property%20to%20Attribute%20from%20numeric.gif)

6. Go back to the Join Diagram tab and, at the top of the page, select the **+** button

    ![Add data](./images/2%20Upload%20joint%20excel%20file/6%20Go%20back%20to%20join%20diagram%20tab%20and%20add%20File%20.jpg)

7. Select the Excel file speed from your computer. Once the speed file populates, click **OK**

    ![import data](./images/2%20Upload%20joint%20excel%20file/7%20Add%20speed%20file%20and%20click%20ok.png)

8. Open the speed tab and change the highlighted column Segment ID to Attribute.

    ![Change data type](./images/2%20Upload%20joint%20excel%20file/8%20Speed%20Tab%20and%20change%20the%20data%20type.jpg)

9. Go to the Join Diagram tab and create an Inner Join by selecting Segment from route data and Segment ID from speed data.

    ![Inner join](./images/2%20Upload%20joint%20excel%20file/9%20Inner%20Join.gif)

10. Save this file as route.

    ![save](./images/2%20Upload%20joint%20excel%20file/10%20Save%20the%20file.jpg)

You have now loaded the excel files as **datasets** into OAC.
Next we will build the map and add layers to it.

Congratulations on completing this lab!

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
