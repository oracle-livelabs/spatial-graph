# Access Spatial Studio

## Introduction

This lab walks through the process of accessing Oracle Spatial Studio (Spatial Studio) from an Oracle LiveLabs Reservation. Your environment includes Spatial Studio and an Autonomous Database. On the first login to Spatial Studio you will provide connection information for your Autonomous Database. 

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Download the Cloud Wallet for your Autonomous Database
* Perform 1st-time login to Spatial Studio supplying Autonomous Database connection info

### Prerequisites

* A completed LiveLabs reservation for "Introduction to Oracle Spatial Studio" 

<!-- *This is the "fold" - below items are collapsed by default* -->

## Task 1: Download Cloud Wallet for your Autonomous Database 

1. In Workshop Details, note your Cloud user name, password, Compartment, and Spatial Studio IP address. Then launch the Cloud Console.

## Task 2: Spatial Studio First-Time Login 

1. You will now use the Spatial Studio IP address you noted earlier. Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to **https://[your Spatial Studio IP address]:4040/spatialstudio**. For example, if your Spatial Studio IP address is 123.123.12.123 then you would navigate to https://123.123.12.123:4040/spatialstudio. Because your Spatial Studio instance is not configured with a signed SSL certificate you will see a browser-specific security warning. Accept the warning and proceed to the site. In a production environment a certificate would be configured and this would not occur. Log in with user **admin** and password **welcome1**.

2. First-time login to Spatial Studio prompts you to enter database connection information for Spatial Studio's metadata repository. Click **Autonomous Database** and then **Next**. On the next scren, drag and drop the wallet file you downloaded previously and click **Ok**.

 Spatial Studio is now building its metadata tables in Autonomous Database. This will take roughly 30 seconds.

4. When Spatial Studio opens, the first-time login is complete and you are ready to proceed with the workshop.
