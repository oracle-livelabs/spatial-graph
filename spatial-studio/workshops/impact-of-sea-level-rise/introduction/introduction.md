# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will provision Spatial Studio and Autonomous Database to the Oracle Cloud from the OCI Cloud Marketplace. You will then load, configure, visualize, and analyze spatial data related to the impact of sea level rise.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes

### About Oracle Spatial Studio

Oracle Spatial Studio (Spatial Studio) is a web application providing self-service access to the spatial capabilities of Oracle Database. While these capabilities have historically required coding and/or use of 3rd party tools, Spatial Studio allows business users to create and share spatial analysis and interactive web maps using a self-service web user interface.

Spatial Studio operates on spatial data in Oracle Database, meaning tables and views that include Oracle's geometry data type. This data be be pre-existing spatial data or non-spatial data which is prepared using Spatial Studio to add geometries based on attributes.

Spatial Studio is a Java EE application that may be deployed to Oracle Cloud from the Oracle Cloud Marketplace. Spatial Studio can also be deployed manually to Oracle WebLogic, Tomcat, or as a pre-deployed Jetty bundle ("Quick Start").
