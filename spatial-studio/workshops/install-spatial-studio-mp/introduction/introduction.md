### About Oracle Spatial Studio

Oracle Spatial Studio (Spatial Studio) is a web application providing self-service access to the spatial capabilities of Oracle AI Database. While these capabilities have historically required coding and/or use of 3rd party tools, Spatial Studio allows business users to create and share spatial analysis and interactive web maps using self-service GUIs.

Spatial Studio operates on spatial data in Oracle AI Database, meaning tables and views that include Oracle's geometry data type. This data can be pre-existing spatial data or non-spatial data which is prepared using Spatial Studio to add geometries based on attributes.

Spatial Studio is a Java EE application that may be deployed to Oracle Cloud from the Oracle Cloud Marketplace. Spatial Studio can also be deployed manually to Oracle WebLogic or Jetty, or as a self contained pre-deployed Quick Start for testing.
