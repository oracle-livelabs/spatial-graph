9.  Drop SCHOOLS onto the map. Style opaque green fill, white stroke.
   
10. Drop TRI_FACILITIES onto the map. Style opaque magenta fill, white stroke.

11. Drop PARCELS onto the map. Drag to bottom of layers. Zoom in. Style lt grey fill, dark grey stroke.

## Task 2: Configure map layers
   
1. Style PARCELS by PCAT 
    
2. Style TRI\_FACILITIES by risk score
   
3. Configure SCHOOL and TRI\_FACILITY info windows
