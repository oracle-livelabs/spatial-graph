# Import Notebook

## Introduction

Notebooks enable you to execute code and to work interactively with long workflows. You can analyze it and visualize graph results using a notebook. In this lab we will be exporting the movie_recommentations notebook.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

Learn how to

- use Graph Studio to create a graph from existing tables or views.

### Prerequisites

- The following lab requires an Autonomous Database Serverless instance.
- And that the Graph-enabled user exists. That is, a database user with the correct roles and privileges exists.

## Task 1: Access the Autonomous Database

1. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **Autonomous Database**.

## Task 2: Log into Graph Studio
[](include:adb-goto-graph-studio.md)
<!---
    The Home icon ![Home icon](images/home.svg "") takes you to the Home page.  
    The Graph page ![Graphs icon](images/radar-chart.svg "") lists existing graphs for use in notebooks.  
    The Notebook page ![Notebook icon](images/notebook.svg "") lists existing notebooks and lets you create a new one. 
    The Templates page ![Template icon](images/template.svg "")  let's you create templates for the graph visualizations.
    The Jobs page ![Jobs icon](images/server.svg "") lists the status of background jobs and lets you view the associated log if any.

## Task 3: Import the notebook

 You can import a notebook that has the graph queries and analytics. Each paragraph in the notebook has an explanation.  You can review the explanation, and then run the query or analytics algorithm.   

  [Click here to download the notebook](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles/Movie%20Recommendations%20-%20Personalized%20SALSA.dsnb) and save it to a folder on your local computer.  This notebook includes graph queries and analytics for the MOVIE_RECOMMENDATIONS graph.

 1. Click the **Notebook** icon. Import a notebook by clicking on the notebook icon on the left, and then clicking on the **Import** icon on the far right.

    ![Click the notebook icon and import the notebook.](images/task3step1.png " ")
    
     Select or drag and drop the noteboook and click **Import**.

    ![Select the notebook to import and click on Import.](images/task3step2.png " ")

    A dialog pops up named **Environment Attaching**. It will disappear when the compute environment finishes attaching, usuallly in less than one minute. Or you can click **Dismiss** to close the dialog and start working on your environment. Note that you will not be able to run any paragraph until the environment finishes attaching.
