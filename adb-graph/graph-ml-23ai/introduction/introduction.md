# Introduction

## About This Workshop

This is the era of generative AI. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables enterprises to use their business data with large language models (LLMs) and use generative AI features when working with their business data. In addition, graph data models are increasingly popular across different industry verticals, as they easily capture relationships in data and make it easy to navigate complex relationships. See how we can employ the power of graph connections together with the latest RAG techniques to benefit from the full power of generative AI in various use cases. Learn how all these can be done inside the database using the latest Oracle Database 23ai features: SQL property graphs and AI Vector Search.

Estimated Workshop Time: 65 minutes

### About Graph Studio

Oracle Autonomous Database can function as a scalable graph database. It has features to automate the creation of graph models and in-memory graphs from database tables. It includes notebooks and developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL and SQL. With Oracle Database 23ai developers can use SQL syntax for graph queries, making it trivial to integrate with SQL APIs for vector search and other database APIs.   Graph Studio includes over 80 built-in graph algorithms, and many visualizations including native graph visualization.

Watch the following two videos for more information on Graph Studio. The first is an introduction to property graphs and their use cases. The second is a tour of the Graph Studio interface.
