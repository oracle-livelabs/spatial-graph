# Introduction

## About This Workshop

This is the era of generative AI. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables enterprises to use their business data with large language models (LLMs) and use generative AI features when working with their business data. In addition, graph data models are increasingly popular across different industry verticals, as they easily capture relationships in data and make it easy to navigate complex relationships. See how we can employ the power of graph connections together with the latest RAG techniques to benefit from the full power of generative AI in various use cases. Learn how all these can be done inside the database using the latest Oracle AI Database features: SQL property graphs and AI Vector Search.

Estimated Workshop Time: 65 minutes

### About Graph Studio

Oracle Autonomous AI Database can function as a scalable graph database. It has features to automate the creation of graph models and in-memory graphs from database tables. It includes notebooks and developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL and SQL. With Oracle AI Database, developers can use SQL syntax for graph queries, making it trivial to integrate with SQL APIs for vector search and other database APIs.   Graph Studio includes over 80 built-in graph algorithms, and many visualizations including native graph visualization.

Watch the following two videos for more information on Graph Studio. The first is an introduction to property graphs and their use cases. The second is a tour of the Graph Studio interface.

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:

* Examples of how to combine Graph Studio and Generative AI services using SQL
* Run a vector search in SQL
* Create a property graph from relational tables using SQL
* Run graph queries using SQL, with the syntax from the SQL:2023 standard implemented in Oracle AI Database
* Run graph queries combined with vector search

### Prerequisites

* Oracle Account
<!---
* A database user with the correct roles and privileges for working with **Graph Studio**. That is, successful completion of Lab 1 of the [Get Started with Graph Studio workshop](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/adb/shared/adb-graph/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=lab-1-create-graph-user)
