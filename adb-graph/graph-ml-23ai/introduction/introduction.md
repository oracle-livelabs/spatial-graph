# Introduction

## About This Workshop

This workshop introduces key graph data modeling and analysis concepts and the interactive Graph Studio for working with graphs in an Autonomous Database. It shows you how to use graph queries to use graph machine learning, vector search, RAG and LLMs for information retrival. We will be looking at movie data, and idenitfying the right movie for customers.

Estimated Workshop Time: 65 minutes

### About Graph Studio

Oracle Autonomous Database has features that enable it to function as a scalable property graph database. They automate the creation of graph models and in-memory graphs from database tables. They include notebooks and developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL and SQL. PGQL is a SQL-like graph query language, over 60 built-in graph algorithms, and many visualizations including native graph visualization.

Watch the following two videos for more information on Graph Studio. The first is an introduction to property graphs and their use cases. The second is a tour of the Graph Studio interface.

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:
* Create a graph using SQL
* Load the graph into memory for analysis
* Create a notebook
* Query and visualize the graph using PGQL notebook paragraphs

### Prerequisites

* Oracle Cloud Account
* Provisioned Autonomous Database-Serverless instance
<!---
* A database user with the correct roles and privileges for working with **Graph Studio**. That is, successful completion of Lab 1 of the [Get Started with Graph Studio workshop](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/adb/shared/adb-graph/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=lab-1-create-graph-user)
