# Introduction

## About This Workshop

<!---This workshop introduces key data modeling and analysis concepts using the interactive Graph Studio for working with graphs in an Autonomous Database, and the Generative AI service in OCI. It shows you how to use graph queries to enhance machine learning, vector search, RAG and LLMs for information retrieval. We will be looking at movie data, and identifying the right movie to recommend to our customers.--->
This is the era of generative AI. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables enterprises to use their business data with large language models (LLMs) and thus participate in the generative AI wave. In addition, graph data models are becoming employed more and more across different industry verticals, as they easily capture relationships in the data that most data models fail to capture. See how we can employ the power of graph connections together with the latest RAG techniques to benefit from the full power of generative AI in various use cases including information retrieval. Learn how all these can be done inside the database using the latest Oracle Database 23ai features: SQL property graphs and AI Vector Search.

Estimated Workshop Time: 65 minutes

### About Graph Studio

Oracle Autonomous Database has features that enable it to function as a scalable property graph database. They automate the creation of graph models and in-memory graphs from database tables. It includes notebooks and developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL and SQL. PGQL is a SQL-like graph query language, with over 70 built-in graph algorithms, and many visualizations including native graph visualization.

Watch the following two videos for more information on Graph Studio. The first is an introduction to property graphs and their use cases. The second is a tour of the Graph Studio interface.

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:

* Learn how to use OCI Generative AI
* Create a graph
* Load the graph into memory for analysis
* Create a notebook
* Query and visualize the graph using SQL Property Graph notebook paragraphs

### Prerequisites

* Oracle Cloud Account
<!---
* A database user with the correct roles and privileges for working with **Graph Studio**. That is, successful completion of Lab 1 of the [Get Started with Graph Studio workshop](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/adb/shared/adb-graph/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=lab-1-create-graph-user)
