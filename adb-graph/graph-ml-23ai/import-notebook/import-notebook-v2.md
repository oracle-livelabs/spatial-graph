## Task 2: Import the notebook

 You can import a notebook that has the graph queries and analytics. Each paragraph in the notebook has an explanation.  You can review the explanation, and then run the query or analytics algorithm.

  [Click here to download the notebook](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/MOVIE_RECOMMENDATIONS.dsnb) and save it to a folder on your local computer.  This notebook includes graph queries and analytics for the MOVIE_RECOMMENDATIONS graph.

 1. Click the **Notebook** icon. Import a notebook by clicking on the notebook icon on the left, and then clicking on the **Import** icon on the far right.

    ![Click the notebook icon and import the notebook.](images/task3step1.png " ")

    ![Select the notebook to import and click on Import.](images/task3step2.png " ")

    A dialog pops up named **Compute Environment**. It will disappear when the compute environment finishes attaching, usually in less than one minute. Or you can click **Close** to close the dialog and start working on your environment. Note that you will not be able to run any paragraph until the environment finishes attaching.
