## Introduction

Notebooks enable you to execute code and to work interactively with long workflows. You can analyze and visualize graph results using a notebook. In this lab we will be importing the movie_recommendations notebook.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

Learn how to

- Log into Graph Studio
- Import a notebook

### Prerequisites

- The following lab requires an Autonomous Database Serverless instance.
- And that the Graph-enabled user exists. That is, a database user with the correct roles and privileges exists.

## Task 1: Import the notebook

 You can import a notebook that has the graph queries and analytics. Each paragraph in the notebook has an explanation.  You can review the explanation, and then run the query or analytics algorithm.

  [Click here to download the notebook](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/MOVIE_RECOMMENDATIONS.dsnb) and save it to a folder on your local computer.

    A dialog pops up named **Compute Environment**. It will disappear when the compute environment finishes attaching, usually in less than one minute. Or you can click **Close** to close the dialog and start working on your environment. Note that you will not be able to run any paragraph until the environment finishes attaching.
