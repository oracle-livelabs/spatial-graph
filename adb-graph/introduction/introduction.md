# Introduction

## About This Workshop

## Note: *Update in progress. Will have errors.*

This workshop introduces key graph data modeling and analysis concepts and the interactive Graph Studio for working with graphs in an Autonomous Database.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes

### About Graph Studio
Oracle Autonomous Database contains features that enable it to function as a scalable property graph database. They automate the creation of graph models and in-memory graphs from database tables. They  include notebooks and developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL, a SQL-like graph query language, and nearly 60 built-in graph algorithms, and offer dozens of visualizations including native graph visualization.

Watch the following two videos for more information. The first is an introduction to property graphs and their use cases. The second is a tour of the Graph Studio interface.

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:
* Connect to your autonomous database using **Graph Studio**
* Quickly create a graph from scratch using PGQL (a graph query language)
* Load graphs into memory for analysis
* Create a notebook
* Write and execute basic Markdown, PGX Java and PGQL notebook paragraphs
* Visualize graph data
 
### Prerequisites
* An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported
* A provisioned Autonomous Database on Shared Infrastructure

**Note**: *If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available.* **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)**
