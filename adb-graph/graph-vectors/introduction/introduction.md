# Introduction

## About This Workshop

Graph data models are popular across different industry verticals, as they easily capture relationships in data and make it easy to navigate complex relationships. See how we can employ the power of graph connections together with vector search techniques in various use cases. Learn how all these can be done inside the database using the latest Oracle Database 23ai features: SQL property graphs and AI Vector Search.

Estimated Workshop Time: 65 minutes

### About Graph Studio

Oracle Autonomous Database can function as a scalable graph database. It has features to automate the creation of graph models in the database and to load graphs into memory for graph analytics. It includes notebooks and developer APIs for executing graph queries and running graph algorithms using SQL and Python APIs. Developers can use SQL syntax for graph queries the database, making it trivial to integrate with SQL APIs for vector search and other database APIs. Graph Studio includes over 80 built-in graph algorithms, and native graph visualization.

Watch the following two videos for more information on Graph Studio. The first is an introduction to property graphs and their use cases. The second is a tour of the Graph Studio interface.
