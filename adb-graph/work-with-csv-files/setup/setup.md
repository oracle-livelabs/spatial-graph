# Setup: Run stack

## Introduction

In this lab you will create a stack that will run a terraform script to generate an Autonomous Database, create a graph user, and upload the dataset that will be used.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes.

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

Learn how to
- Run the stack to create an Autonomous Database, Graph user, and upload dataset
- Login to Graph Studio

## Task 1: Create OCI compartment

[](include:iam-compartment-create-body.md)

## Task 2: Run stack

The instructions below will show you how to run a stack that will automatically create an Autonomous Database containing a graph user and the dataset needed for the property graph queries.

1. Login to the Oracle Cloud.

2.  Once logged in, use this [link](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-arch-graph/releases/latest/download/orm-graph-stack.zip) to create and run the Stack.
    > Note: the link will open in a new tab or window.

3. You will be directed to this page:

    ![The create stack page](./images/create-stack.png "")

4.  Check the "I have reviewed and accept the Oracle Terms of Use" box and choose your compartment. Leave the rest as default. Click **Next**.

    ![Option to have reviewed and accept the Oracle Terms of Use checked](./images/oracle-terms.png "")

5. Select the **compartment** to create the Autonomous Database and the Database Type. Click **Next**. After that you will be taken to the Review page, click **Create**.

6. You will be taken to a Job Details page with an initial status shown in orange. The icon will become green once the job has successfully completed.

    To see information about your application click on **Application Information**. Save the graph username and password since you will be using it to login to Graph Studio.

## Task 3: Login to Graph studio

1. Click on **Open Graph Studio** under the Application Information. This will open a new page. Enter your graph username and password provided under Application Information, into the login screen.

    ![Open graph studio under Application Information](./images/login-page.png " ")

2. Then click the **Sign In** button. You should see the studio home page.   

    ![ALT text is not available for this image](./images/gs-graphuser-home-page.png " ")

    Graph Studio consists of a set of pages accessed from the menu on the left.

    The **Home** icon takes you to the Home page.<br>
    The **Graph** page lists existing graphs for use in notebooks.<br> 
    The **Notebook** page lists existing notebooks and lets you create a new one.<br>                                                                                             The **Templates** page let's you create templates for the graph visualizations.<br>
    The **Jobs** page lists the status of background jobs and lets you view the associated log if any.<br>
