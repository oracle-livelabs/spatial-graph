# Graph Studio: Create a graph using PGQL CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH statement

## Introduction

In this lab you will create a graph from the `bank_accounts` and `bank_txns` tables using Graph Studio and the CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH statement.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes.

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

Learn how to
- use Graph Studio and PGQL DDL (that is, CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH statement) to model and create a graph from existing tables or views.

### Prerequisites

- The following lab requires an Autonomous Database - Serverless.
- And that the Graph-enabled user (`GRAPHUSER`) exists. That is, a database user with the correct roles and privileges exists.

## Task 1: Access the Autonomous Database 

1. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **Autonomous Database**.

    ![Navigating to Autonomous Database.](images/navigation-menu.png " ") 

2. Select the compartment provided on **View Login Info**, and click on the **Display Name** for the **Autonomous Database**. 

    ![Selecting Autonomous Database in the Navigation Menu.](images/select-autonomous-database.png " ") 

## Task 2: Log into Graph Studio

Graph Studio is a feature of Autonomous Database. It is available as an option on the Database Actions Launchpad. You need a graph-enabled user to log into Graph Studio. This user was already created for you.  

1. In your **Autonomous Database Details page** page, click the **Database Actions** button, and then select **View all database actions**.

    ![Click the Database Actions button](images/click-database-actions.png " ")    

2. On the Database Actions panel, click **Graph Studio**.

    ![Click Open Graph Studio](images/graphstudiofixed.png " ")

3. Log in to Graph Studio. Use the credentials for the database user GRAPHUSER.

    ![Use the credentials for database user MOVIESTREAM](images/graph-login.png " ")

    Graph Studio consists of a set of pages accessed from the menu on the left.

    The **Home** icon takes you to the Home page.<br>
    The **Graph** page lists existing graphs for use in notebooks.<br> 
    The **Notebook** page lists existing notebooks and lets you create a new one.<br>                                                                                             The **Templates** page let's you create templates for the graph visualizations.<br>
    The **Jobs** page lists the status of background jobs and lets you view the associated log if any.<br>

## Task 3: Create a graph of accounts and transactions

1. Click the **Graph** icon. Then click **Create Graph**.  
   
    ![Shows where the create button modeler is](images/graph-create-button.png " ")  

2. Enter `bank_graph` as the graph name, then click **next**. The description and tags fields are optional.   
    That graph name is used throughout the next lab.  
    Do not enter a different name because then the queries and code snippets in the next lab will fail.  
    
    ![Shows the create graph window where you assign the graph a name](./images/create-graph-dialog.png " ")

3. Expand **GRAPHUSER** and select the `BANK_ACCOUNTS` and `BANK_TXNS` tables. 

    ![Shows how to select the BANK_ACCOUNTS and BANK_TXNS](./images/select-tables.png " ")

4. Move them to the right, that is, click the first icon on the shuttle control.   

    ![Shows the selected tables](./images/selected-tables.png " ")

5. Click **Next**. We will edit and update this graph to add an edge and a vertex label.  

    The suggested graph has the `BANK_ACCOUNTS` as a vertex table since there are foreign key constraints specified on `BANK_TXNS` that reference it.   

    And `BANK_TXNS` is a suggested edge table.

    ![Shows the vertex and edge table](./images/create-graph-suggested-model.png " ")    

6. Now let's change the default Vertex and Edge labels.  

    Click the `BANK_ACCOUNTS` vertex table. Change the Vertex Label to **ACCOUNTS**. Then click the checkmark to confirm label and save the update.  

    ![Changed the label name of the vertex to Accounts](images/edit-accounts-vertex-label.png " ")  

    Click the `BANK_TXNS` edge table and rename the Edge Label from `BANK_TXNS` to **TRANSFERS**. Then click the checkmark to confirm label and save the update. 

    ![Changed the label name of the edge to Transfers](images/edit-edge-label.png " ")  

    This is **important** because we will use these edge labels in the next lab of this workshop when querying the graph. Click **Next**.   

<!---
6.  Since these are directed edges, a best practice is verifying that the direction is correct.  
    In this instance we want to **confirm** that the direction is from `from_acct_id` to `to_acct_id`.  

    >**Note:** The `Source Vertex` and `Destination Vertex` information on the left.  

    ![Shows how the direction of the vertex is wrong](images/wrong-edge-direction.png " ")  

    **Notice** that the direction is wrong. The Source Key is `to_acct_id` instead of what we want, which is `from_acct_id`.  

    Click the swap edge icon on the right to swap the source and destination vertices and hence reverse the edge direction.  

    >**Note:** The `Source Vertex` is now the correct one, i.e. the `FROM_ACCT_ID`.

    ![Shows how the direction is correct](images/reverse-edge-result.png " ")

7. Click the **Source** tab to verify that the edge direction, and hence the generated CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH statement, is correct.

    ![Verifies that the direction of the edge is correct in the source](images/generated-cpg-statement.png " ")  


  **An alternate approach:** In the earlier Step 5 you could have just updated the CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH statement and saved the updates. That is, you could have just replaced the existing statement with the following one which specifies that the SOURCE KEY is  `from_acct_id`  and the DESTINATION KEY is `to_acct_id`.  

    ```
    -- This is not required if you used swap edge in UI to fix the edge direction.
    -- This is only to illustrate an alternate approach.
    <copy>
    CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH bank_graph
        VERTEX TABLES (
            BANK_ACCOUNTS as ACCOUNTS
            KEY (ACCT_ID)
            LABEL ACCOUNTS
            PROPERTIES (ACCT_ID, NAME)
        )
        EDGE TABLES (
            BANK_TXNS
            KEY (FROM_ACCT_ID, TO_ACCT_ID, AMOUNT)
            SOURCE KEY (FROM_ACCT_ID) REFERENCES ACCOUNTS
            DESTINATION KEY (TO_ACCT_ID) REFERENCES ACCOUNTS
            LABEL TRANSFERS
            PROPERTIES (AMOUNT, DESCRIPTION)
        )
    </copy>
    ```

   ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/correct-ddl-save.png " " )  

   **Important:** Click the **Save** (floppy disk icon) to commit the changes.
--->

7. In the Summary step, click on **Create Graph**. 

    ![Shows the job tab with the job status as successful](./images/jobs-create-graph.png " ")  

    This will open a Create Graph tab, click on **Create Graph**. 

    ![Shows in-memory enabled and the create graph button](./images/create-graph-in-memory.png " ")

    After this, you will be taken to the Jobs page where the graph will be created.  

    
    This concludes this lab. **You may now proceed to the next lab.**
