# Introduction

## About This Workshop

This workshop introduces key graph data modeling and analysis concepts and the interactive Graph Studio for working with graphs in an Oracle Autonomous AI Database. It shows you how to use graph queries to find circular payments which may indicate fraudulent transactions. You will be querying data containing (artificial) accounts and transactions information. You will start by creating a graph and finally querying it and visualize the results.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes

### About Graph Studio

Oracle Autonomous AI Database has features that enable it to function as a scalable property graph database. Automating the creation of graph models and in-memory graphs from database tables. Graph Studio includes notebooks and developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL, a SQL-like graph query language, and SQL/PG. With over 80 built-in graph algorithms, and many visualizations including native graph visualization.

Watch the following two videos for more information on Graph Studio. The first is an introduction to property graphs and their use cases. The second is a tour of the Graph Studio interface.

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:

* Create a graph using PGQL's (a graph query language) CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH statement
* Load the graph into memory for analysis
* Create a notebook
* Query and visualize the graph using PGQL notebook paragraphs

### Prerequisites

* Oracle Cloud Account
* Provisioned Oracle Autonomous AI Database-Serverless instance
<!---
* A database user with the correct roles and privileges for working with **Graph Studio**. That is, successful completion of Lab 1 of the [Get Started with Graph Studio workshop](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/adb/shared/adb-graph/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=lab-1-create-graph-user)
