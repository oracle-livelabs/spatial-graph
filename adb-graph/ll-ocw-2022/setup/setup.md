# Setup: Run Stack

## Introduction

In this lab you will run a slack that will generate an Autonomous Database, create a Graph User, and upload the dataset that will be used.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes.

### Objectives

Learn how to
- Run the stack to create an Autonomous Database, Graph user, and upload dataset
- Login to Graph Studio

## Task 1: Run Stack

The instructions below will show you how to run a stack that will automatically create an Autonomous Database containing a graph user and the dataset needed for the property graph queries.

1. Login to the Oracle Cloud.
2.  Once logged in, use this [link](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/orac[â€¦]/oci-arch-graph/releases/latest/download/orm-graph-stack.zip) to create run the Stack.
3. You will be directed to this page:

  ![The create stack page](./images/create-stack.png "")

  - Check the "I have reviewed and accept the Oracle Terms of Use" box. Leave the rest as default. Click **Next**.

  ![Option to have reviewed and accept the Oracle Terms of Use checked](./images/oracle-terms.png "")

4. Leave the Configure Variables settings as default. Click **Next**. After that you will be taken to the Review page, click **Create**.
5. When the job has succeeded, You will see the status turn from orange to green.

## Task 2: Login to Graph studio

1. Click the **Open Graph Studio** under the Application Information. This will open a new page. Enter your graph username and password provided under Application Information, into the login screen.

  ![Open graph studio under Application Information](./images/login-page.png " ")

2. Then click the **Sign In** button. You should see the studio home page.   

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](./images/gs-graphuser-home-page.png " ")

  Graph Studio consists of a set of pages accessed from the menu on the left.

  The Home icon ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/home.svg "") takes you to the Home page.  
  The Models icon ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/code-fork.svg "") takes you to the Models page where you start modeling your existing tables and views as a graph and then create, or instantiate, a graph.  
  The Graph page ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/radar-chart.svg "") lists existing graphs for use in notebooks.  
  The Notebook page ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/notebook.svg "") lists existing notebooks and lets you create a new one.  
  The Jobs page ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/server.svg "") lists the status of background jobs and lets you view the associated log if any.

  This concludes this lab. *You may now proceed to the next lab.*
