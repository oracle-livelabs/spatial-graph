# Provision Resources

## Introduction

This lab will walk you thru provisioning an Autonomous Database, adding API keys in the Oracle Cloud Console and adding a database user for Graph studio. 

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives


In this lab, you will:
* Provision an Autonomous Database
* Create API Key in OCI
* Create Autonomous Database user with access to Graph Studio
 

### Prerequisites

 
This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Cloud account with privileges to access Generative AI services, provision Autonomous Database and add API keys
 

## Task 1: Create Autonomous Database

This task involves creating Autonomous Database 23ai.

1. Locate Autonomous Databases under Oracle Databases. Click on Create Autonomous Database.

2. Provide information for Compartment, Display name, Database name. Also, choose workload type as Data Warehouse or Transaction Processing one of these workload types are needed for Graph Studio.

## Task 2: Create API Key in OCI

This task involves creating and API Key in OCI, the key will be needed in creating an AI profile for the data generation.

1. Login the OCI Console and click the person icon on the top right.

## Task 3: Create the Graph User


1. Open the service detail page for your Autonomous Database instance in the OCI console.  

   Then click on **Database Actions** and select **View all database actions**.

2. Login as the ADMIN user for your Autonomous Database instance.

    ![Log in to your Autonomous Database instance](./images/sign-in-admin.png "Log in to your Autonomous Database instance")

3. Click the **DATABASE USERS** tile under **Administration**.

4. Click the **+ Create User** icon.

5. Enter the required details, i.e. user name and password. Turn on the **Graph Enable** and **Web Access** radio buttons. And select a quota, e.g. **UNLIMITED**,  to allocate on the `DATA` tablespace.   

    >**Note:** The password should meet the following requirements:

    - The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.
    - The password cannot contain the username.
    - The password cannot contain the double quote (â€œ) character.
    - The password must be different from the last 4 passwords used for this user.
    - The password must not be the same password that is set less than 24 hours ago.

    >**Note:** Please do not Graph Enable the ADMIN user and do not login to Graph Studio as the ADMIN user. The ADMIN user has additional privileges by default. 

    Click the **Create User** button at the bottom of the panel to create the user with the specified credentials.

    The newly created user will now be listed.
