# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop shows how Generative AI can be used to create an informative property graph from the text of a Sherlock Holmes story and  how to use the graph for retrieval augmented generation. The workshop will guide users through provisioning the required resources, generating a property graph, visualizing the property graph and using the property graph for retrieval augmented generation. 

Estimated Workshop Time: 3 hours 

### About Graph Studio
Oracle Autonomous Database has features that enable it to function as a scalable graph database. They automate the creation of graph models and in-memory graphs from database tables. They include notebooks and developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL, a SQL-like graph query language, over 60 built-in graph algorithms using Java or Python APIs, and native graph visualization.

Watch the following two videos for more information on Graph Studio. The first is an introduction to property graphs and their use cases. The second is a tour of the Graph Studio interface.

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:
* Vectorize text data for ingestion
* Use Generative AI to summarize text chunks for graph edge/vertex relationships 
* Transform responses from LLM into suitable format for creating Property Graph
* Create graph studio notebook
* Query and visualize the graph using PGQL notebook paragraphs
* Use graph information for retrieval augmented generation

### Prerequisites

* Oracle Cloud Account   
* Access to OCI Autonomous Database (ADB)
* Access to a Region where the Generative AI service is available: Chicago, Frankfurt
* Must have an Administrator Account or Permissions to manage several OCI Services: Generative AI Services, Autonomous Database 
 
<!---
* A database user with the correct roles and privileges for working with **Graph Studio**. That is, successful completion of Lab 1 of the [Get Started with Graph Studio workshop](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/adb/shared/adb-graph/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=lab-1-create-graph-user)
