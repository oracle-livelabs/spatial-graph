# Sign up for an APEX Workspace

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to get started using Oracle APEX on Oracle Autonomous Database (Autonomous Transaction Processing [ATP]). In this lab, you provision a new ATP instance and create an APEX workspace.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Navigate to the Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing cloud service using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console.
- Provision a new Autonomous Transaction Processing database.
- Create an APEX workspace.

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

## Task 2: Create a APEX workspace

1. Within your new database, APEX is not yet configured. Therefore, when you first access APEX, you will need to log in as an APEX Instance Administrator to create a workspace.

    Click the **APEX instance URL** provided on the ATP overview screen.

    ![Open APEX instance](images/apex-instance-v2.png " ")

2. Now, click **Launch APEX**

3. Enter the password for the Administration Services and click **Sign In to Administration**.
    The password is the same as the one for the ADMIN user. You can find this password in the **View Login Info** tab.

4. Click **Create Workspace**.

5. Depending on how you would like to create your workspace, select **New Schema** or **Existing Schema**. If you are getting started, select **New Schema**.

    ![Choose type of schema](images/choose-schema.png " ")

6. In the Create Workspace dialog, enter the following:

    | Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Workspace Name | DEMO |
    | Workspace Username | DEMO |
    | Workspace Password | *password* |

    Click **Create Workspace**.

    ![Create Workspace dialog](images/create-workspace.png " ")

7. In the APEX Instance Administration page, click the **DEMO** link in the success message.
    >**Note:** This will log you out of APEX Administration so that you can log into your new workspace.

## Summary

  At this point, you know how to create an APEX Workspace and you are ready to start building amazing apps, fast.

  You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
