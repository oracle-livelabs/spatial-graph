## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to get started using Oracle APEX on Oracle Autonomous Database (Autonomous Transaction Processing [ATP]). In this lab, you provision a new ATP instance and create an APEX workspace.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Navigate to the Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing cloud service using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console.
- Provision a new Autonomous Transaction Processing database.
- Create an APEX workspace.

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

## Task 2: Create a APEX workspace

1. Within your new database, APEX is not yet configured. Therefore, when you first access APEX, you will need to log in as an APEX Instance Administrator to create a workspace.

    Click the **Apex Instance URL** provided on the ATP overview screen.

2. Now, click **Launch APEX**

3. Enter the password for the Administration Services and click **Sign In to Administration**.     
    The password is the same as the one for the ADMIN user. You can find this password in the **View Login Info** tab.
