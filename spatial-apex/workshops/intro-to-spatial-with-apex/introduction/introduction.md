# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will explore mapping in Oracle APEX using the Map Region feature and Oracle Spatial. You will install and explore a pre-built sample application with many useful mapping examples. You will then create your own application with and configure maps both using a wizard and from scratch.

The Map Region is a native APEX feature introduced in APEX 21.1 providing the ability to configure interactive maps displaying spatial data from Oracle Spatial, GeoJSON, and coordinates. This workshop focuses on using Oracle Spatial as the spatial data source, so that both raw spatial data and spatial analysis results be easily incorporated.

### About Oracle Application Express (APEX) and Oracle Spatial

Oracle Application Express (APEX) and Oracle Spatial are features of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) services.

Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a low-code development platform that enables you to build scalable, secure enterprise apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere. More at [Oracle APEX Product homepage](https://apex.oracle.com)

Oracle Spatial is a set of geospatial data management, analysis, and processing capabilities within Oracle Database. With a native spatial data type and analysis operations, location-based analysis is mainstream and co-located with all other database operations.

### Objectives

* Understand APEX Map Region samples
* Learn to create and configure Map Region
* Learn to incorporate location analysis with Oracle Spatial

### Prerequisites

* Oracle APEX 21.1+ is required. The screenshots in this workshop are taken using APEX 21.2. Since we generally recommend using the [latest version of APEX](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/apex-downloads/), expect occasional small differences in the user interface.
* Basic experience with Oracle APEX is recommended, though not required. If needed, review the following introductory LiveLabs APEX workshop: [Creating an App based on Existing Tables for Oracle Autonomous Cloud Service](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=628).
* Basic experience with Oracle Spatial is recommended, though not required. If needed, review the following introductory LiveLabs Spatial workshop: [Introduction to Oracle Spatial](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=736)
