# Create the Graph

## Introduction

Now, the tables are created and populated with data. Let's create a graph representation of them.

Estimated time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

Learn how to create a graph representation of your existing tables by:

- Using SQL to create and query a graph

### Prerequisites

- This lab assumes you have successfully completed the lab - Create and populate tables.

## Task 1: Create a graph

Run the following SQL create property graph statement in SQL.

```
<copy>
CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH customer_360
  VERTEX TABLES (
    customer
      KEY (id)
      LABEL customer
      PROPERTIES ALL COLUMNS,
    account
      KEY (id)
      LABEL account
      PROPERTIES ALL COLUMNS,
    merchant
      KEY (id)
      LABEL merchant
      PROPERTIES ALL COLUMNS
  )
  EDGE TABLES (
    account as owned_by 
      KEY (id)
      SOURCE KEY (id) REFERENCES account(id)
      DESTINATION KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(id)
      LABEL owned_by
      PROPERTIES ALL COLUMNS,
    
    parent_of
      SOURCE KEY (customer_id_parent) REFERENCES customer(id)
      DESTINATION KEY (customer_id_child) REFERENCES customer(id)
      LABEL parent_of
      PROPERTIES ALL COLUMNS,

    purchased
      SOURCE KEY (account_id) REFERENCES account(id)
      DESTINATION KEY (merchant_id) REFERENCES merchant(id)
      LABEL purchased
      PROPERTIES ALL COLUMNS,

    transfer
      SOURCE KEY (account_id_from) REFERENCES account(id)
      DESTINATION KEY (account_id_to) REFERENCES account(id)
      LABEL transfer
      PROPERTIES ALL COLUMNS
  );
</copy>
```

For more about DDL syntax, please see [Introduction to SQL Property Graphs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/property-graph/25.2/spgdg/sql-property-graph.html). Please note that *all columns of the input tables are mapped to the properties of vertices/edges by default. For **owned_by** edge, only **id** property is given with **PROPERTIES** keyword for edge ID generation purpose, and the other properties are not given, because they are already hold by the account vertices.

## Task 2: Query the graph

You can use PGQL now to query the graph LetÂ´s start with a list of all vertex labels:

```python
<copy>
graph.query_pgql("""
  SELECT DISTINCT LABEL(v) FROM MATCH (v)
""").print()
</copy>

+----------+
| LABEL(v) |
+----------+
| ACCOUNT  |
| CUSTOMER |
| MERCHANT |
+----------+
```

Find out next how many vertices each label has:

```python
<copy>
graph.query_pgql("""
  SELECT LABEL(v), COUNT(v) FROM MATCH (v) GROUP BY LABEL(v)
""").print()
</copy>

+---------------------+
| LABEL(v) | COUNT(v) |
+---------------------+
| MERCHANT | 5        |
| ACCOUNT  | 6        |
| CUSTOMER | 4        |
+---------------------+
```

Select all edge labels:

```python
<copy>
graph.query_pgql("""
  SELECT DISTINCT LABEL(e) FROM MATCH ()-[e]->()
""").print()
</copy>

+-----------+
| LABEL(e)  |
+-----------+
| OWNED_BY  |
| PARENT_OF |
| PURCHASED |
| TRANSFER  |
+-----------+
```

Find out next how many edges each label has:

```python
<copy>
graph.query_pgql("""
  SELECT LABEL(e), COUNT(e) FROM MATCH ()-[e]->() GROUP BY LABEL(e)
""").print()
</copy>

+----------------------+
| LABEL(e)  | COUNT(e) |
+----------------------+
| OWNED_BY  | 4        |
| TRANSFER  | 8        |
| PARENT_OF | 1        |
| PURCHASED | 11       |
+----------------------+
```

## Task 5: Publish the graph

The newly created graph is "private" by default, and is accessible only from the current session. To access the graph from other sessions, you can "publish" the graph.

Use the following command to publish it.

If you're no longer in the session, create the graph again following the procedure above. If you are still in the same session, you do not need to repeat Task 3. Publish the graph.
```python
<copy>
graph.publish()
</copy>
```

Next time you connect you can access the graph kept in memory without re-loading it, if the graph server has not been shutdown or restarted between logins.
```python
<copy>
graph = session.get_graph("customer_360")
</copy>
```

Please note that you are allowed to publish graphs because **`PGX_SESSION_ADD_PUBLISHED_GRAPH`** role has been granted when the user is created. Otherwise, it has to be granted by **ADMIN** user and you must re-connect with the Python shell to pick up the updated permissions.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
