# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will identify suspicious financial transactions based on analysis involving location and time ("spatiotemporal"). Python has emerged as a platform of choice for data analysis involving a combination of back-end database and specialized open source libraries. This is especially true in the area of geospatial analysis and AI, where a robust ecosystem of Python modules dovetails with the native spatial capabilities of Oracle Database.

Estimated Workshop Time: xx minutes

### About Oracle Spatial and python-oracledb

Oracle Spatial is a set of geospatial data management, analysis, and processing capabilities within Oracle Database. With a native spatial data type and analysis operations, location-based analysis is mainstream and co-located with all other database operations. More at [Oracle Spatial Product homepage](https://www.oracle.com/database/spatial)

The python-oracledb driver is an open source Python module that enables programs to access Oracle Database. python-oracledb makes it easy to access Oracle Database (including Oracle Autonomous Database)from Python and leverage features such as large object types, Advanced Queuing, Continuous Query Notification, and much more.
