# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will identify suspicious financial transactions based on analysis involving location and time ("spatiotemporal"). Both the spatial features of Oracle Database (i.e., "Oracle Spatial") and Python libraries are used. Oracle Spatial performs back-end large scale location analysis and enrichment  based on relationships and measurements such as proximity, containment, distance and area. Python provides an environment for data analysis and machine learning leveraging a vast ecosystem of mature specialized libraries, including spatiotemporal analysis. The python-oracledb driver enables connectivity and robust access to Oracle Database, so that the strengths of both the Oracle back-end and Python client are optimally leveraged.

Estimated Workshop Time: xx minutes

### About Oracle Spatial and python-oracledb

Oracle Spatial is a set of geospatial data management, analysis, and processing capabilities within Oracle Database. With a native spatial data type and analysis operations, location-based analysis is mainstream and co-located with all other database operations. More at [Oracle Spatial Product homepage](https://www.oracle.com/database/spatial)

The python-oracledb driver is an open source Python module that enables programs to access Oracle Database. python-oracledb makes it easy to access Oracle Database (including Oracle Autonomous Database)from Python and leverage features such as large object types, Advanced Queuing, Continuous Query Notification, and much more.
