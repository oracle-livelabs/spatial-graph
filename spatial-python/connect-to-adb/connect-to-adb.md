# Connect to  Autonomous Database from Python


## Introduction

To prepare for data loading and analysis, you first establish a connection from Python to your Autonomous Database. The python-oracledb driver supports this connection and all subsequent database interactions.  You will use the python-oracledb driver's ‘Thin’ mode which connects directly to Oracle Database and does not need Oracle Client libraries. 

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

* Connect to Autonomous Database from Python

### Prerequisites

* Completion of Lab 2: Create Autonomous Database

## Task 1: Create connection parameter files

1. To avoid including database connection information directly in your notebook, you create files with this information which your notebook can reference. In JupyterLab, click on the Text File tile to create a new text file.

2. Enter your ADB ADMIN user password. Then from the File menu select **Save Text**.

3. When prompted enter **my-pwd.txt** as your file name and click **Rename**.

4. Close the text file tab to return to the Launcher page.

5. Return to your Oracle Cloud browser tab click on **Database Connection**.

1. Scroll down to the Connection Strings section. For TLS Authentication, select **TLS**. This is required to allow Thin mode connections. Then Under Connection String click **Copy** for the TNS Name ending in \_low.

1. Return to your JupyterLab browser tab. As done previously, click on the Text File tile to create another new text file. Paste the connection string just copied from your Autonomous Database. Then save the file and rename to **my-dsn.txt**.

  As done previously, close the text file tab to return to the Launcher page.

## Task 2: Create notebook and connect to Autonomous Database

1. From the Launcher, click the **Python 3** tile to create a new notebook.
  ![Connect to ADB](images/connect-to-adb-09.png)

1. In the first cell, paste the following statement and then click the **run** button. This loads the python-oracedb module which handles interaction with Oracle Database. 

     ```
     <copy>
     import oracledb
     </copy>
     ```
     ![Connect to ADB](images/connect-to-adb-10.png)

2. In the next cell, paste the following statements and then click the **run** button. This loads your ADB password and DSN into variables

     ```
     <copy>
     # Get ADB password and DSN from file
     my_pwd = open('./my-pwd.txt','r').readline().strip()
     my_dsn = open('./my-dsn.txt','r').readline().strip()
     </copy>
     ```
     ![Connect to ADB](images/connect-to-adb-11.png)

3. In the next cell, paste the following statements and then click the **run** button. This creates a connection to your ADB.

     ```
     <copy>
     # Create database connection and cursor
     connection = oracledb.connect(user="admin", password=my_pwd, dsn=my_dsn)
     cursor = connection.cursor()
     </copy>
     ```
     ![Connect to ADB](images/connect-to-adb-12.png)

3. In the next cell, paste the following statements and then click the **run** button. This runs a test query to verify successful connection to ADB.

     ```
     <copy>
     # Run a test query
     cursor.execute("select object_type, count(*) from all_objects group by object_type")
     for row in cursor.fetchmany(size=10):
       print(row)
     </copy>
     ```
     ![Connect to ADB](images/connect-to-adb-13.png)


4. Right-click on your notebook file Untitled.ipynb in the left panel and select **Rename**.

5. Enter **my-notebook** (or a name of your choosing). Observe the notebook name is changed.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
